For many companies, acquiring new customers is one of the largest cost items in customer management. 
According to a well-known rule of thumb, it is about five times more expensive to acquire a new customer 
than to retain an existing one. Customer retention and loyalty are therefore essential goals of a solid business strategy. 
Preventing customer churn through preventative measures should be standard practice for every company.

Deep Learning in Churn Prediction
Classic forecasting models from the fields of data science and AI can be used to predict customer churn 
and assign a probability. These forecasting models include, for example, logistic regression, decision trees, 
or modern deep learning methods (e.g., neural networks).
